# Industrial Deep Diagnostic

## Core Principle

**Evidence first. Reasoning second. Conclusions last.**

Every conclusion must cite its evidence source and rank (1=direct data, 2=user docs, 3=statistics, 4=visual, 5=process logic, 6=web, 7=hypothesis). No unsupported assumptions. No exaggerated causal claims.

### Agent Decoupling via Workspace Files

Agents do NOT share context through the main agent. They communicate exclusively through files in the workspace directory:

```
Context Builder ──► 01_ontology/ontology.json, schema.json
                        ↓
Data Processor  ──► 02_processed/feature_summary.json
                 ──► 03_figures/*.png
                 ──► 03_figures/plot_manifest.json  ← INTERFACE CONTRACT
                        ↓
Diagnostician   ──► 04_diagnostics/diagnosis.json, evidence.json, confidence.json
                        ↓
Judge           ──► 05_review/judge_feedback.json
                        ↓
Reporter        ──► report.md, run_summary.json
```

**Key interface: `plot_manifest.json`** — the data-processor writes it to tell the diagnostician exactly what plots exist, why each was generated, and HOW (time alignment, normalization, function used).

**Script philosophy**: Node.js for fixed operations (zero dependency, always works). Python as adaptive toolkit — the agent reads data first, then selects visualization primitives based on data dimensions.

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Setup Workspace

```bash
node <skill_path>/scripts/setup.mjs --name <scene_name> --base-dir ./workspace/diagnostic-runs
```

This creates a structured workspace:
```
workspace/diagnostic-runs/<timestamp>_<name>/
├── 00_input/          ← data manifest, user context
├── 01_ontology/       ← ontology.json, schema.json
├── 02_processed/      ← cleaned data, feature summary
├── 03_figures/        ← plots (PNG) + plot_manifest.json
├── 04_diagnostics/    ← diagnosis, evidence, confidence
├── 05_review/         ← judge feedback
├── 06_scripts/        ← custom Python scripts written by agent
├── report.md          ← final report
└── run_summary.json   ← run metadata
```

### Step 1: Inspect Data (MAIN)

```bash
node <skill_path>/scripts/inspect.mjs <data_path>
```

This outputs JSON with column names, types, stats, time column detection, and preview. **Read this output carefully** — it tells you exactly what the data looks like.

Then ask the user clarification questions (max 5 at a time). Only ask what you cannot infer from the inspection results.

Save `input_manifest.json` and `user_context.json` to `00_input/`.

### Step 2: Context Building (SUB-AGENT)

Read `agents/context-builder.md` and spawn a sub-agent. Pass: DATA_PATH, RUN_DIR, REFERENCE_DIR, PROCESS_DESCRIPTION, SKILL_PATH.

### Step 3: Data Processing + Adaptive Visualization (SUB-AGENT)

Read `agents/data-processor.md` and spawn a sub-agent. This agent follows a structured decision protocol:

1. **Inspect data** (node inspect.mjs) → understand structure
2. **Compute statistics** (node stats.mjs) → correlations, anomalies
3. **Classify data pattern** using `detect_data_pattern()`:
   - 1D scalar, multi-axis, 2D profile, batch/event, spectral, or mixed
4. **Select visualization primitives** from the toolkit based on pattern
5. **Apply time alignment** if sampling is irregular (via `align_timeindex()`)
6. **Compose and run** custom visualization script
7. **Write `03_figures/plot_manifest.json`** — tells the diagnostician:
   - What plots exist, what each shows
   - HOW each was generated (function, alignment, normalization)
   - What to look for (interpretation hints)

The visualization toolkit (`scripts/template_visualize.py`) provides composable primitives for ALL dimension types — the Agent selects which ones to use based on the actual data.

### Step 4: Diagnosis (SUB-AGENT)

Read `agents/diagnostician.md` and spawn. The diagnostician:
1. Reads `plot_manifest.json` FIRST — the interface contract from data-processor
2. Uses `generation_method` fields to understand HOW each plot was created
3. Reads each plot image via VLM
4. Combines visual (Rank 4) + statistical (Rank 3) + direct (Rank 1) evidence

### Step 5: Judge Review (SUB-AGENT)

Read `agents/judge.md` and spawn. If score < 90, loop back to Step 4 (max 3x).

### Step 6: Report (SUB-AGENT)

Read `agents/reporter.md` and spawn.

### Step 7: Present Results (MAIN)

Show the user: executive summary, key findings, primary diagnosis, top recommendations, workspace path.

## Parallel Execution

Steps 2 and 3 can run **in parallel**. Steps 4→5→6 must be **sequential**.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/industrial-deep-diagnostic` | Full pipeline |
| `/industrial-deep-diagnostic analyze` | Skip intake, run from Step 2 |
| `/industrial-deep-diagnostic review` | Re-run judge on existing results |
| `/industrial-deep-diagnostic report` | Regenerate report from existing artifacts |

## Script Reference

### Node.js (fixed, zero-dependency, always works)

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `inspect.mjs` | Inspect data file, output schema & stats | `node inspect.mjs <file> [--rows N]` |
| `stats.mjs` | Correlations, z-scores, abnormal intervals | `node stats.mjs <data.json> --time-col X --target-cols A,B` |
| `setup.mjs` | Create workspace directory structure | `node setup.mjs --name X [--base-dir D]` |

### Python Toolkit (agent selects primitives based on data dimensions)

| Section | Primitives | When |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Data Utilities | `load_data`, `align_timeindex`, `detect_data_pattern`, `normalize_01` | Always available |
| 1D Scalar | `plot_multi_panel_timeseries`, `plot_normalized_overlay`, `plot_anomaly_zoom`, `plot_coupling_scatter`, `plot_correlation_heatmap` | Scalar time-series (default) |
| 2D Profile | `plot_profile_evolution`, `plot_position_time_heatmap`, `plot_deviation_from_target` | Spatial/position data |
| Multi-Axis | `plot_orbit`, `plot_axis_ratio` | Multi-direction measurements |
| Batch/Event | `plot_box_by_group`, `plot_event_timeline` | Categorical grouping columns |
| Spectral | `plot_spectrogram`, `plot_dominant_frequency` | Frequency-domain data |
| Manifest | `write_plot_manifest` | Always — generates the interface contract |

The agent reads the toolkit, classifies data dimensions, selects relevant primitives, and composes a custom script. NOT a fixed template — adapts to what the data actually looks like.

### Python Templates (agent customizes per dataset)

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `template_preprocess.py` | Missing values, outlier detection, resampling |

## Diagnosis Language

| Type | Marker | Template |
|------|--------|----------|
| Observation | [OBSERVATION] | "[Variable] [changed] by [X%] from [T1] to [T2]." |
| Inference | [INFERENCE] | "This coincides with [event/measurement]." |
| Hypothesis | [HYPOTHESIS] | "This suggests [mechanism] may have contributed." |
| Uncertainty | [UNCERTAINTY] | "Evidence is [level] to [conclude X]." |

## Anti-Speculation

NEVER state root cause without: (1) temporal precedence, (2) statistical evidence, (3) physical mechanism, (4) no contradicting evidence. If ANY missing, use [HYPOTHESIS].

ALWAYS disclose confidence, evidence gaps, and assumptions.
